Financial Analysis of Cristo Inc.

For my first assignent I was tasked with providing a summary table of a clients financial data over a several years. I was only provided with a data sheet, which included the date and profit/loss. To complete this task I used Python to read the data, count the total number of months, display the total profit, the average change in profit/loss over the data set, and lastly the greatest Increase and Decreases in the data provided.


Voting in Pawnee

My second task was to generate a code to calculate the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of their votes, and the winner using Python. I created dictionary for the candidates, thus creating a for loop to get the initial counts, then forcing it through an else statement that collected the remaing votes for each candidate. I then created a sorted tuple to add to the dictionary. Reorganized the Dictionary by casting votes and candidates together.
